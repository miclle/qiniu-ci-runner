# E2B GitHub Runner

Small Go service that starts ephemeral GitHub Actions self-hosted runners inside E2B sandbox instances.

## Configuration

Runtime configuration is file-first. `runnerd` reads `./runnerd.yaml` by default, or the path passed with `--config`.

Start from the example:

```bash
cp runnerd.yaml.example runnerd.yaml
```

The config file covers:

- server listen address and timeouts
- database backend and DSN/path
- admin auth token
- E2B API settings and template
- GitHub webhook settings plus GitHub App, PAT, or basic auth
- worker lease / retry / concurrency settings

Relative sqlite `database.url` and `github.app.private_key_file` paths are resolved from the directory containing `runnerd.yaml`.
GitHub Enterprise Server is not currently supported; configure a GitHub.com App installation.
Configure exactly one GitHub auth method: `github.app`, `github.token`, or `github.basic_auth`. For GitHub App auth, `github.app.installation_id` is optional. When it is omitted, runnerd resolves the installation from each job repository and caches installation transports, allowing one GitHub App to serve multiple installed accounts.
`github.allowed_repositories` is an optional allowlist of `owner/repo` or `owner/*` patterns. Empty means all repositories that can deliver valid webhooks and match runner labels/policies are allowed.

`/webhooks/github` uses GitHub HMAC signature verification. The manual management API under `/runner_requests` requires `Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN`.

Runner state is persisted in a DB-backed store instead of per-request JSON directories. Control/stdout/stderr logs are kept as runner events and remain available from the admin API and UI.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/runnerd --config ./runnerd.yaml
```

## Docker

The container image is file-config only. Mount `runnerd.yaml` and any referenced secret files into the container; environment variables such as `HTTP_ADDR` are not used for runtime config.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 25500:25500 \
  -v "$PWD/runnerd.yaml:/etc/runnerd/runnerd.yaml:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/secrets:/etc/runnerd/secrets:ro" \
  ghcr.io/jimyag/e2b-github-runner
```

Open the embedded admin console at `http://127.0.0.1:25500/admin/`. The UI is built from `ui/` with the same React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-style components, and theme tokens used by `kubevirt-console`. It stores `ADMIN_TOKEN` in browser local storage and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN` for management API calls.

The admin console manages runner requests, runner specs, runner groups, runner policies, retry actions, audit history, runner-spec match tests, and diagnostics. Runner specs, groups, and repository policies are created through the admin API/UI rather than `runnerd.yaml`. runnerd creates repository runners by default; when a matched runner spec has a GitHub runner group, it creates an organization runner for the job repository owner and passes that group as `--runnergroup`.

Create runner specs with meaningful names such as `ubuntu-24-04` or `ubuntu-24-04-large`; set each spec `template_id` to the E2B template that contains the GitHub runner image. The admin API validates that the template exists and has a usable build before saving a runner spec. Runner specs with `default_available: true` are globally available to allowed installed repositories. Use `github.allowed_repositories` to limit which repositories can use this runnerd instance, and use runner policies when a repository needs access to an additional/special spec.

runnerd caches valid GitHub registration tokens per repository or organization, retries runner registration inside the sandbox, and best-effort removes the GitHub runner registration when a sandbox is stopped or recovered.

The binary also imports `github.com/jimmicro/pprof`, so a local-only pprof/expvar service is started automatically and discovered through generated `.pprof` address files and dump scripts. The admin console exposes a diagnostics page that summarizes the discovered pprof endpoint, `/debug/vars`, DB state, GitHub auth mode, sandbox API configuration, retry/lease metrics, and recent failures. The expvar metrics include ARC-style workflow job counts, conclusions, failures, queue/run duration totals and counts, runner registration/cleanup counters, GitHub API operation counters, and Fireactions-style profile current/busy/idle/pending/desired gauges.

## Build

```bash
task build
task docker-build
task template-build-prod
```

Useful validation commands:

```bash
task lint
task test
task docker-check
task release-check
```

Use `runs-on: [self-hosted, e2b]` in the target workflow. Configure a GitHub webhook for `workflow_job` events pointing at `POST /webhooks/github`; runnerd handles `queued`, `in_progress`, and `completed` actions. You can also include `workflow_run` events as a compensating signal; runnerd lists all queued jobs in the run and enqueues any matching jobs not already seen from `workflow_job`.
