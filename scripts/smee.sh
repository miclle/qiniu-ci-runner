[smee] .smee-url not found; skipping webhook forwarder.

To enable GitHub webhook forwarding:

  1. Get a channel URL: open https://smee.io/new
  2. Save it to .smee-url: echo 'https://smee.io/<your-channel>' > .smee-url
  3. Configure the same URL as the GitHub webhook URL.
  4. Run task smee.

Set SMEE_TARGET if runnerd is not listening on http://127.0.0.1:25500.
